- new interface
	/*
		interface.js currently contains the play back and update interface functions ...
	*/
	- abbreviation for lns.interface - ui or gui or something funny
	- interface is object literal?
		- advantage of functions is controlling when they run without having to make everything one big literal ... 
	- folder for drawings/layers/settings interfaces 
		- adding palette as sub module issues:
			- key command, not part of interface.json
			- could add to lns.interface.keys in ui
			- or use line in code like in interface itself
			- palette key command didnt work previously ...
			- 
	- hide and show interfaces panels - or add
		- make them and then display: none or dont make them at all?
		- might help with key command issues ... 
		- key commands currently tied to panels existing ... creating breaks this
		- any reason not to build interfaces? other than feels "nicer"?
	- set panel order more sophisticated
	- work on interface classes to update themselves
	- review key commands - don't really use segnum, jiggle
	- add capture interface/panel
	- cut layer segment / line ... 
	- update layer color saved as new color button
	- possible to update interface values without lns.ui.faces ? 
	- save layouts
	- panel use uis
	- tool tips don't work with hidden things ... 


- issues
	- color btn update color picker value
	- double setting color picker
	- need to set values like canvas on load
		- files load sets canvas, fps, lps, line color etc.
		- not modular but can be made modular if this is ever modular ....
		- loading settings, need to set ui values
	- fix onion skin lightness
	- ui interfaces, set vs setValue
	- layers display confusing because only see that frame ... 
	- btn to reset animation values
	- deleting frames need to delete indexs in layers

- thinkers
	- rndr object in layer { r, n, w, v } ... xy?
	- persistent layer interface? key commands?
	- object for layers and drawings with hash keys
	- remove fonts.css?
	- frame ui
	- frames and layers??
	- blender like window system????
	- frames get their own canvas display

- possible features
	- change onion skin color
	- option to loop back to beginning of frames, option to stop at end, option not to create frames beyond last frame
	- center lines canvas in larger area
	

- interface 
	- go back later
		- canvas, capture references fio ui
			- capture is separate module? or part of fio?
			- kind of fine either way?
			- leads into bigger classes, animation etc. questions
			- same with fit frames to canvas
		- draw events, reset defaults
			- affiliate functions? idk how to do this, maybe not worth it
		- layer 
			- add/use color btns
		- fio setting interface values with width/height/fps/lps on open
			- don't really care can fix later
			- callback on animation load

	- modules vs program
	- any reference to Lines/lns is technically non-modular
		- background - ctx argument
		- canvas has a ton - sort of part of interface
			- fio
			- bg color
			- capture
		- color - add color btn - should be part of interface ... too complicated for json tho
		- data - every function - basically interface
		- draw - interface for parameters, lines to add lines, canvas
		- fio - everything  - also "interface"
		- interface - duh
		- render - current frame, canvas, lines, layers, drawings, 
	- interface.faces with sub modules interfaces.faces.drawingInterface.seg num bla

- play rndr - is this is the new way to do it?
	- maybe for performance, play and game, for animate, doesn't matter as much
	- use lines player as animation class for game?
	- game separates the canvas/render from animation ... 
	- animation in games should use rndr, would be nice to have ONE draw/render func for all three 

- "animation" class with layers, drawings, etc?
- range slider for offset ? 
	
- old color values need #
- add drawings if fucked up
- handler undefined interface 161
- bg color wtf
- saved wrong color ffffff
- frame layer toggled in file


- game thoughts 
	- animation class doesn't automatically load src, maybe need protocol for this
	- setanimsize is confusing, better protocol here
	- combine loaded json and file
	- Game.start - needed something like this before
	- canvas.getContext - still necessary?



idtio - lines 
- render module
- no more drawing indexes, random keys, or name drawing

- draw/data ui code
- generic update ui function

- system for adding and removing ui components - frames, layers, drawings ... 


- layers issues for later 
	- copy with frame between then add to previous frame, makes two layers ... not that big of a deal, not super common
	- pasting on multiple frames adds consecutive layers ...

- layer display design
	- max width for one layer

- ios safari
	- un focus buttons - not focus, hover - worry about this later ...
	- touch event type, stylus or direct
	- hidable menu
	- custom menu with added buttons that are large
	- mobile styles use Cool.mobilecheck

	- saving files with names/extension - ios issue
	- always airdrop - not doable
