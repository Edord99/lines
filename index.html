interface idea - read through functions in each module and make interface if they match dict pairs
	- means interfaces have to call functions, no wierd callbacks
	- work on interface classes to update themselves

- interface 
	- go back later
		- canvas, capture references fio ui
			- capture is separate module? or part of fio?
			- kind of fine either way?
			- leads into bigger classes, animation etc. questions
			- same with fit frames to canvas
		- draw events, reset defaults
			- affiliate functions? idk how to do this, maybe not worth it
		- layer 
			- add/use color btns
		- fio setting interface values with width/height/fps/lps on open
			- don't really care can fix later
			- callback on animation load

	- modules vs program
	- any reference to Lines/lns is technically non-modular
		- background - ctx argument
		- canvas has a ton - sort of part of interface
			- fio
			- bg color
			- capture
		- color - add color btn - should be part of interface ... too complicated for json tho
		- data - every function - basically interface
		- draw - interface for parameters, lines to add lines, canvas
		- fio - everything  - also "interface"
		- interface - duh
		- render - current frame, canvas, lines, layers, drawings, 
	- interface.faces with sub modules interfaces.faces.drawingInterface.seg num bla


play rndr - is this is the new way to do it?
- maybe for performance, play and game, for animate, doesn't matter as much
- use lines player as animation class for game?
- game separates the canvas/render from animation ... 
- animation in games should use rndr, would be nice to have ONE draw/render func for all three 

- key commands for layers ... not really necessary unless im wanting during development
- files with a lot of drawings the same settings ? like letters.json
- combine explode and reverse (with multi, simultaneous)
- param to delete first frame in explode - this will annoy me
- "animation" class with layers, drawings, etc?
- range slider for offset ? 
- review key commands - don't really use segnum, jiggle 

errors
- need to set values like canvas on load
	- files load sets canvas, fps, lps, line color etc.
	- not modular but can be made modular if this is ever modular ....
	
- old color values need #
- add drawings if fucked up
- handler undefined interface 161
- bg color wtf
- saved wrong color ffffff
- frame layer toggled in file
- clear settings doesn't really work if settings just gets saved on reload
- onion skin color line color
- layer resetting not working
- display layer in layers panel? or drawing
- plus frame key command doesn't disappear
- toggle just toggles values? no callback?
- open with same drawing 

- hide and show interfaces panels

- game thoughts 
	- animation class doesn't automatically load src, maybe need protocol for this
	- setanimsize is confusing, better protocol here
	- combine loaded json and file
	- Game.start - needed something like this before
	- canvas.getContext - still necessary?



idtio - lines 
- render module
- follow over missing first segment?
- offset doesn't work with xy frames
- html color pickers
- save palette order in settings
- fix onion skin lightness
- delete up to last "end" - also clean up cut segment 
- explode to set length (maybe wait for layers)
- explode doesn't push frames (also wait for layers)

- no more drawing indexes, random keys, or name drawing

- draw argument "time" could just be capture is true
- draw/data ui code

- remove fonts.css?
- frame ui

- interface folder
- generic update ui function
- option to loop back to beginning of frames, option to stop at end, option not to create frames beyond last frame
- save xy as array
