<!-- 

interface idea - read through functions in each module and make interface if they match dict pairs
	- means interfaces have to call functions, no wierd callbacks
	- work on interface classes to update themselves
lns -- lns.draw = function() ... like p5.prototype.ellipse etc.
interfaces classes in separate files

play rndr - is this is the new way to do it?
- maybe for performance, play and game, for animate, doesn't matter as much
- use lines player as animation class for game?
- game separates the canvas/render from animation ... 
- animation in games should use rndr, would be nice to have ONE draw func for all three 

- convert file code
- decide on v3 vs v2.2?
- key commands for layers ...
