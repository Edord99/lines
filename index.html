11.6.2019
- drawings interface - 0 issue 
- update "animation" to "tween"
- deprecate "re-open" and make it crate the src= link
- update cssFrames with ui panel
	- buttons in the layer panel in HTML
- fixing layers/other interfaces so they're not being deleted and rebuilt
- making ui values that are automatically updated more easily
- key command - f, then number, then just goes? no enter?

- new interface
	- interface.js currently contains the play back and update interface functions ...
	- system for adding and removing ui components - frames, layers, drawings ... 

- issues
	- general issue of setting ui values when various properties changes (lines properties good example)
		- mutation observer work in the case of elements like canvas with width
		- moving them to callback in ui files
		- setting with ui.faces ... 
		- getters??? setters???
	- old color values need #

- thinkers
	- rndr object in layer { r, n, w, v } ... xy?
	- persistent layer interface? key commands?
	- object for layers and drawings with hash keys
	- frames and layers??
	- blender like window system????
	- frames get their own canvas display
	- support for multiple line widths ... 
	- layers display confusing because only see that frame ... 
	- drawing class?
	- better layer highlighting?
	- editor own directory

- possible features
	- change onion skin color
	- option to loop back to beginning of frames, option to stop at end, option not to create frames beyond last frame
	- center lines canvas in larger area
	- set panel order more sophisticated - live with the idiosyncracy for now ... 
	- panel use uis
	- styling interface
	- range slider for offset ? 
	- no more drawing indexes, random keys, or name drawing

- layers, adding drawings
	- new added drawing always make new layers if non contiguous with original layer
	- need to check for multiple layers - not high priority tho

- interface 
	- go back later
		- canvas, capture references fio ui
			- capture is separate module? or part of fio?
			- kind of fine either way?
			- leads into bigger classes, animation etc. questions
			- same with fit frames to canvas
		- draw events, reset defaults
			- affiliate functions? idk how to do this, maybe not worth it
		- layer 
			- add/use color btns
		- fio setting interface values with width/height/fps/lps on open
			- don't really care can fix later
			- callback on animation load


	- interface.faces with sub modules interfaces.faces.drawingInterface.seg num bla
	- ui interfaces, set vs setValue - set used by display and text for setting text and placeholder ...

- play rndr - is this is the new way to do it?
	- maybe for performance, play and game, for animate, doesn't matter as much
	- use lines player as animation class for game?
	- game separates the canvas/render from animation ... 
	- animation in games should use rndr, would be nice to have ONE draw/render func for all three 
	
- add drawings if fucked up
- handler undefined interface 161
- bg color wtf
- saved wrong color ffffff
- frame layer toggled in file
- clear settings doesn't really work if settings just gets saved on reload
- display layer in layers panel? or drawing
- plus frame key command doesn't disappear
- toggle just toggles values? no callback?
- open with same drawing 
- separate settings for drawing lines ? 

- game notes
	- item has text label, is that just relevant to idtio?
	- interactive extends items to play "interact state"
	- character 
	- scenes - dont need this to be a default, nice to have seperate from game or can extend game
		- unless there's a scene class?
		- scene change sound - used to stop start sound in idtio, could be sfx ...
		- scene change could be Game function
	- sound generally
		- toggle sound
	- loading module???
		- load ui, map
	- user class or module
	- 

- game thoughts 
	- animation class doesn't automatically load src, maybe need protocol for this
	- combine loaded json and file
	- canvas.getContext - still necessary?


- layers issues for later 
	- copy with frame between then add to previous frame, makes two layers ... not that big of a deal, not super common
	- pasting on multiple frames adds consecutive layers ...

- ios safari
	- un focus buttons - not focus, hover - worry about this later ...
	- touch event type, stylus or direct
	- hidable menu
	- custom menu with added buttons that are large
	- mobile styles use Cool.mobilecheck

	- saving files with names/extension - ios issue
	- always airdrop - not doable

- vsc to dos
	- game
		- loading doesn't wait for sprites to actually load
			- sprites jump on load
		- 
	- game editor 
		- fill page with game, floating ui?
		- empty lines filling up tool menus
		- double select all items
		- click to locate item from game to editor
		- too many textures in panel
			- collapsible hierarcy ie unity
		- key command to "add" texture - better word for texture?
	- animate
		- title saving on enter key command thing
		- lineWidth not applied from settings to actual drawing
		- consolidate "update interface"
		- copy/paste/cut fucked up still
		- lines props dont change with layers toggled
		- too many layers visible in panel
		- cut top/bottom layer not working correctly
		- frame number switches when switching tabs (number key commands)
		- capture seconds of video
		- reset defaults error / palette error
		- item/texture edit go to frame number
		- drawing that doesnt have layer ...
		- rndr module?
		- lots of layer toggle issues
		- edit palette
		- generate/load/save palettes
		- custom ui panel
		- states panel - state editor, naming
		- still working on decent frame counting ... 
		- video capture countdown
		- visual layer editor
		- saving empty layers .. ?
	- interface
		- big set/update version ...
		- range class?


todo/interesting
- item window for game
- collapsible hierarchy for game
	- hide textures, items, or instances
	- groups?
- ui layouts for layers
- game/editor delayed loading
- game item/class render toggle
