interface idea - read through functions in each module and make interface if they match dict pairs
	- means interfaces have to call functions, no wierd callbacks
	- work on interface classes to update themselves

- interface 
	- sub interfaces?  background of draw(render) not really necessary,
		- except colors ... 
		- ignore for now ... 
	- go back later
		- fuckin rows - canvas x and y 
		- background updating the ranges when images is added ...
		- cool but not that necessary?
		- canvas, capture references fio ui
		- color, att btns, need color ways ui
		- bg color (in canvas) - don't *really* need color ways for this one
		- data - fucking arguments!
		- interface/draw - update onion toggle
		- draw events, reset defaults
			- affiliate functions?
		- layer - update cut segment for layers ... change color too
			- layer/drawing panel makes UIs etc
	- module parameter in list vs as key, check when all interfaces are done
	- handler AND callback ???
	- confusing that text and input mean same thing ...
	- different style for toggle btn?
	- setters are done in interface ... just add a param ... 
		- okay this is the real shit
	- wrap drawing interface into interface? 


play rndr - is this is the new way to do it?
- maybe for performance, play and game, for animate, doesn't matter as much
- use lines player as animation class for game?
- game separates the canvas/render from animation ... 
- animation in games should use rndr, would be nice to have ONE draw/render func for all three 

- key commands for layers ... 
- files with a lot of drawings the same settings ? like letters.json
- combine explode and reverse (with multi)
- param to delete first frame in explode
- lns lns -- lns.draw = function() ... like p5.prototype.ellipse etc.
- mouse events = draw, draw = render?
- "animation" class with layers, drawings, etc?
- settings keep panels open
