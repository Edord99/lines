interface idea - read through functions in each module and make interface if they match dict pairs
	- means interfaces have to call functions, no wierd callbacks
	- work on interface classes to update themselves

- interface 
	- go back later
		- canvas, capture references fio ui
			- capture is separate module? or part of fio?
			- kind of fine either way?
			- leads into bigger classes, animation etc. questions
			- same with fit frames to canvas
		- draw events, reset defaults
			- affiliate functions? idk how to do this, maybe not worth it
		- layer 
			- add/use color btns
		- fio setting interface values with width/height/fps/lps on open
			- don't really care can fix later
			- callback on animation load

	- modules vs program
	- any reference to Lines/lns is technically non-modular
		- background - ctx argument
		- canvas has a ton - sort of part of interface
			- fio
			- bg color
			- capture
		- color - add color btn - should be part of interface ... too complicated for json tho
		- data - every function - basically interface
		- draw - interface for parameters, lines to add lines, canvas
		- fio - everything  - also "interface"
		- interface - duh
		- render - current frame, canvas, lines, layers, drawings, 
	- interface.faces with sub modules interfaces.faces.drawingInterface.seg num bla


play rndr - is this is the new way to do it?
- maybe for performance, play and game, for animate, doesn't matter as much
- use lines player as animation class for game?
- game separates the canvas/render from animation ... 
- animation in games should use rndr, would be nice to have ONE draw/render func for all three 

- key commands for layers ... not really necessary unless im wanting during development
- files with a lot of drawings the same settings ? like letters.json
- combine explode and reverse (with multi, simultaneous)
- param to delete first frame in explode - this will annoy me
- "animation" class with layers, drawings, etc?
- range slider for offset ? 
- review key commands - don't really use segnum, jiggle
